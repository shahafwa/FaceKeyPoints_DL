## Project: Image Captioning

### Description

In this project, I trained an a neural network to find keypoints in faces at images.
[![Facial Keypoint Detection](https://github.com/itoro-michael/udacity-facial-keypoint-detection/raw/master/P1_Facial_Keypoints/images/key_pts_example.png "Facial Keypoint Detection")](https://github.com/itoro-michael/udacity-facial-keypoint-detection/blob/master/P1_Facial_Keypoints/images/key_pts_example.png)
### Install

This project requires  **Python 3.x**  and the following Python libraries installed:

-   [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
-   [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
-   [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
-   [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
-   [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an  [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend to install  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook 2. Define the Network Architecture.ipynb

or

jupyter notebook 2. Define the Network Architecture.ipynb

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

YouTube Faces Dataset, which includes videos of people in YouTube videos. These videos have been fed through some processing steps and turned into sets of image frames containing one face and the associated keypoints.


**Target**

-   `locate`: locate keypoints of the face in an image.
